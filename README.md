# HRMBus_Tracker
<h2>JavaScript Program to Track Metro Transit</h2>
This program grabs data from the HRM transit API and uses Leaflet to add bus markers to a map in real time. </br>
Specific information from the API is grabbed, and changed into geoJSON format in order to apply it to Leaflet maps. </br>
The program refreshes every 15 seconds and shows the new position of each bus.
