# HRMBus_Tracker
<h2>JavaScript Program to Track Metro Transit</h2>
This program grabs data from the HRM transit API and uses Leaflet to add bus markers to a map in real time. </br>
Specific information from the API is grabbed, and changed into geoJSON format in order to apply it to Leaflet maps. </br>
The program refreshes every 15 seconds and shows the new position of each bus. </br>
</br>
<h3>Pain Points</h3>
<p> The biggest pain point in this project was understanding the JSON. It took some time to understand each attribute and how it pertained to the transit system.</br>
Another large pain point was figuring out how to clear the map layer of previous flight markers (plane icons) before a new icon was displayed.</br>
To complete this, I watched a few tutorials on youtube with notes on geoJSON and the Leaflet mapping system. </p></br>
<h3>Outcomes Learned</h3>
<p>I found this project to be extremely useful. </br>It utilized: </br>
<ul><li>Leaflet</li>
  <li>JSON and accessing JSON attributes</li>
  <li>API Requests</li>
  <li>Using popups within the HTML to display information</li>
</ul>
